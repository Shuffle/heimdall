# Introduction

Email rules for everyone

## Installation

```bash
pip install shuffle-heimdall
```


## Usage

```python
from heimdall.evaluate import evaluate_email_expression
email_json = '{"sender": "test@example.com"}'
expression = 'email.sender.endsWith("@example.com")'
result = evaluate_email_expression(email_json, expression)
print(result)
```

To see more examples, check out the [main.py](./heimdall/main.py) file.

## To-do

Works on most platforms. The power of heimdall should shine when you have a lot of emails to process but you want to write simple code that is also fast.

- [ ] Add support for outlook API result
- [x] Add support for gmail API result (`evaluate_gmail_expression()`)
- [ ] Add support for gmail API when in mass
- [ ] Make setup.py pull the right binary during install instead of having everything in the repo.
